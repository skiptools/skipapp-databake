# Configuration file for https://skip.tools project
#
# This skip.yml file is associated with an Android App project,
# and buiding it will create an installable .apk file.
#
# The app's metadata is derived from the top-level
# ModuleName.xcconfig file, which in turn are used to generate both the
# AndroidManifest.xml (for the Android apk) and the
# Info.plist (for the iOS ipa).
